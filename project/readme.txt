@par Description

The aim of this example is to explain how to use semaphores through CMSIS-RTOS based
on FreeRTOS APIs.
This example implements two threads with different priorities that share a semaphore to
toggle LEDs, following more details about the execution of the example.

1. The thread 1 which has the higher priority obtains the semaphore and toggle the LED1
for 5 seconds
2. The thread 1 releases the semaphore and suspends itself.
3. The low priority thread can execute now, it obtains the semaphore and resume
execution of the thread 2.
4. As it has the higher priority the thread 1 will try to obtain the semaphore, but it blocks
because the semaphore is already taken by the low priority thread,
5. Thread 2 will toggle the LED2 for 5 seconds, before releasing the semaphore and
begin a new cycle.

0s***************5s****************10s
thread1:higher priority
thread2:
0s:The thread 1 obtains the semaphore and toggle the LED1
5s:The thread 1 releases the semaphore and suspends itself.Thread 2 obtains the semaphore and resume thread 2.
10s:Thread 2 release the semaphore

@note Care must be taken when using HAL_Delay(), this function provides accurate
      delay (in milliseconds) based on variable incremented in SysTick ISR. This
      implies that if HAL_Delay() is called from a peripheral ISR process, then 
      the SysTick interrupt must have higher priority (numerically lower)
      than the peripheral interrupt. Otherwise the caller ISR process will be blocked.
      To change the SysTick interrupt priority you have to use HAL_NVIC_SetPriority() function.
      
@note The application need to ensure that the SysTick time base is always set to 1 millisecond
      to have correct HAL operation.

@note The FreeRTOS heap size configTOTAL_HEAP_SIZE defined in FreeRTOSConfig.h is set accordingly to the 
      OS resources memory requirements of the application with +10% margin and rounded to the upper Kbyte boundary.

on STM32Cube with RTOS".

@par Hardware and Software environment

  - This example runs on STM32F103xE devices.
    
  - This example has been tested with STM3210E-EVAL RevD board and can be
    easily tailored to any other supported device and development board.
    


@par How to use it ?

In order to make the program work, you must do the following:
 - Open your preferred toolchain 
 - Rebuild all files and load your image into target memory
 - Run the example
